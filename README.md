Ansible module used by OSAS to deploy a static website builder. While
working, the role is still being written, as seen by the TODO list at the end
of this document.

Currently this role supports the following web generators:
* Ascii Binder (http://asciibinder.org/)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/)
* Planet (using Planet Venus)

# Example

The role requires a working web server somewhere, if possible managed by ansible
as well. In the simplest invocation, this should be something like this:

```
$ cat deploy_builder.yml
- hosts: webbuilder
  roles:
  - role: builder
    builder_name: website_example_org
    git_url: "https://git.example.org/website.git"
    rsync_location: /var/www/html
    rsync_server: www.example.org
    rsync_user: rsync_user
```

The role defaults to using Middleman, but you can choose the web generator you need
by setting the `builder` variable to either `middleman` or `jekyll`.

This will deploy the build of https://git.example.org/website.git by
using rsync as rsync_user on www.example.org, copying in /var/www/html.

The script will not sync if build failed, and will not send email (that's on the
TODO list, see end of the file). Nevertheless, failures caught by Cron can be
sent to an email address if specified by `cron_error_email`; if you setup
multiple builders using the same UNIX user, then beware only the latest email
defined will be taken into account.

# Handling multiple repositories

In order to support multiple repositories, the script detect if
submodules are used and track the latest commit for each and force update
if needed. While that's not how submodules are supposed to be used, people
often forget to update submodules and so we need to use this as a workaround.

This cannot be turned off for now, but will be added as a option if needed.

# Using with openshift

The role can also be used with non managed services, such as openshift online v2.
For that, you need to deploy the role without giving a `rsync_server` argument.
The openshift URI is taken from the 'data/site.yml' configuration file but can be
overridden using the `openshift` variable.

Then, you need to make sure that `bundle exec middleman deploy` is able to push
the website. In the case of openshift, this implies to let the key in ~/.ssh/$NAME.pub
push to openshift, with Â£NAME replaced by the name given to the role.

# Regular rebuild

The role will rebuild the website on a regular basis, every 6h
by default. This can be changed with the parameter `rebuild_interval`, which express
the time between automated rebuild attempts if nothing changed, expressed in hours.

# Debug the build

In order to debug a non working build, the easiest is to connect to the
server as the non privileged user used to build (with ssh + sudo or su most of the time).

Each website to build will have a directory serving as workspace for the build, that
contains a status file of the form `status_$NAME.yml`

```
$ cat status_website_example_org.yml
last_build: '1467869767'
last_build_commit: 819bcaef161706441f9a4477d664b67a3616049a
last_build_human: Tue Jul  5 03:27:57 2016
submodule_commits: {}
```

Then, the build script can be run with `/usr/local/bin/build_deploy.py -d -f -n ~/website_example_org.yml`,
which would force a build (-f) without pushing (-n) with debug turned on (-d).

# Jenkins integration

If you wish to use the role with a external system to trigger such as Jenkins, you will need to disable
the cronjob use to run the build job on a regular basis. This can be done by setting the variable `external_trigger`
to True. This will also likely requires to use the `--no-refresh` option for the build script to not mess with
Jenkins git updating, depending on the setup you want.

# Missing features

While being already used in production, several options are missing
- notification of failure by sending a email
- notification of the start of a build
  - either by publishing the logs
  - or by pushing a status file on the website
- proper logging of error
- handling automatically some errors (like rebuilding gems)
- change the schedule of automated rebuild
